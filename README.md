# AgentTown

AgentTown is an innovative project that aims to create a dynamic environment where Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can interact with each other optimally. Inspired by the non-player characters (NPCs) in Grand Theft Auto IV, this project seeks to give "brains" to virtual agents, allowing them to learn and adapt in a shared environment.

## Overview

The primary goal of AgentTown is to develop a framework where multiple agents with distinct tasks can coexist, learn, and optimize their behavior over time. Currently, the project focuses on two main agents: a police officer and a thief.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Environment:** A virtual town where multiple RL agents can interact simultaneously.
- **Unique Agent Tasks:** Each agent is assigned specific objectives, creating a dynamic and challenging environment.
- **Individual Training:** Agents are initially trained separately to develop their base skills.
- **Shared Environment Interaction:** Trained agents are placed in the same environment to observe and adapt to each other's behaviors.
- **Obstacle Integration:** The environment includes various obstacles to enhance realism and complexity.

## Current Progress

- The police agent has been successfully trained and implemented.
- The environment has been set up with obstacles and a thief agent for the police to interact with.

## Future Goals

1. Train and implement the thief agent with its unique objectives.
2. Develop mechanisms for agents to learn from observing each other's behaviors.
3. Expand the number and types of agents in the environment.
4. Implement more complex scenarios and interactions between agents.
5. Create a robust framework that allows for easy integration of new agent types and tasks.

## Contributing

AgentTown is actively seeking collaborators to help expand and refine the project.

Areas where contributions would be particularly valuable include:
- Implementing and training the thief agent
- Enhancing the learning algorithms for multi-agent interactions
- Expanding the environment with new features and obstacles
- Developing tools for analyzing agent behavior and performance

## Inspiration

The project draws inspiration from the complex behaviors of NPCs in open-world games like Grand Theft Auto IV. The goal is to create a framework where virtual agents can exhibit intelligent, adaptive behaviors that evolve through interaction and observation.

## Vision

The ultimate vision for AgentTown is to create a versatile framework where agents with similar tasks (like the police and thief) can learn each other's behaviors through observation over time. This has potential applications in various fields, including:

- Game development
- Urban planning simulations
- Law enforcement training scenarios
- Artificial intelligence research

By creating more intelligent and adaptive virtual agents, AgentTown aims to push the boundaries of multi-agent reinforcement learning and contribute to the development of more realistic and engaging virtual environments.
