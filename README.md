AgentTown

AIM: Creating a Environment in which RL agents can interact with each other optimally

let Police and thief be 2 agents we train two agents individually and place them in the same environment, both the agents have unique tasks. The agents should do their tasks optimally.


Inspiration/Motto : GTA IV NPCs, want to give brain to the NPCs.

Final Goal: Create a framework so that similar agents(Two agents with similar tasks like police thief) can learn each other tasks by observing over time.

PS: Looking for collaborators
